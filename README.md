## Tooolbaze

> The browser is very powerful and has a lot of capabailities, so much can be handled on the client, yet I see a lot of "tool websites" make network requests to do things as simple as generating a UUID or converting image formats. I DON'T LIKE THAT.

Toolbaze is a collection of client-side tools that leverage the power of the browser to perform various tasks without needing to make any network requests. This way, it's faster, more private (nothing leaves your browser), more reliable (works offline) and doesn't cost me anything to run, so it can be free forever.

Feel free to add more tools by creating a Pull Request or suggest new tools via the issues section.
